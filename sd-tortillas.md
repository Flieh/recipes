##Ingredients

- 1/2 cup sourdough starter discard
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup water
- 1 2/3 cup all purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp salt

##Instructions

1. In a large bowl, mix the sourdough discard, olive oil and water. Stir to combine.

2. Add the all-purpose flour and salt, mixing until the dough is formed. Knead for 1 to 2 minutes, just until everything is well combined and dough looks homogeneous, with no dry spots. You can use a stand mixer if you prefer. If your dough is too sticky, add 1 tablespoon more of all-purpose flour and knead until absorbed.

3. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.

4. Preheat a large skillet on high heat.

5. Flour lightly the surface youâ€™re opening the dough. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 pieces. Flatten each ball with the palm of your hand.

6.        Roll open each piece of dough into a circle, using a rolling pin or a wine bottle. The tortillas should be rolled thin (about 1/4 inch thickness), and will look almost see-through.

7.        Cook individually on high heat for about 1 minute on each side. Flip it as soon as bubbles appear and the edges look firm: the tortilla should have nice brown spots.

8.        Allow them to cool before storing into an airtight container. Serve them warm.


######Notes

Tortillas keep for 3 to 5 days outside the fridge.

To freeze, wait for them to cool. Use a ziplock bag or airtight container, and separate each tortilla with wax or parchment paper.

The recipe can be made with active sourdough as well: it won't change the final result.

The recipe can be made with whole wheat: use 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour and 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour. I never tried making them with whole wheat only, but if you want to try, start with 1 1/2 cup of whole wheat, and add more flour as you need, until you get a dough you can work with without sticking to the surface when rolling open.
